We&#x27;re happy to show to the world a platform that we&#x27;ve created to help our students get started with Data Science: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notebooks.rmotr.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notebooks.rmotr.com&#x2F;</a></p><p>We know how hard it is to start working with Data Science tools: setting up local environment, installing dependencies, keeping projects organized, etc. RMOTR Notebooks has Jupyter Lab already preinstalled + the ability to upload datasets.</p><p>Our platform is now open to everybody for free, and we are thinking about adding paid tiers in the future with better hardware, GPU support, pro features, etc.</p><p>We&#x27;ve also worked on a &quot;publishing view&quot; for project; so people can share their work with the world: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notebooks.rmotr.com&#x2F;martinzugnoni&#x2F;how-to-trade-bitcoin-with-python-using-the-bollinger-bands-strategy-ce645116\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notebooks.rmotr.com&#x2F;martinzugnoni&#x2F;how-to-trade-bitco...</a></p><p>Would love to hear your feedback.</p>",

I work with Google and myself and a handful of colleagues have utilized the streamlined, intuitive interface for a multitude of projects already.
